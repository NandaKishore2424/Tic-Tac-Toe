The Tic Tac Toe game implemented in Java is a console-based application that provides a classic gaming experience.
Utilizing a 3x3 grid, players alternately make moves, inputting their choices through the console. 
The core of the game is encapsulated in a 2D array representing the game board, and the program ensures the validity of player moves, prompting re-entry for invalid inputs. 
The game concludes when a player successfully aligns three symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, declaring them the winner.
Additionally, the program detects a draw if the entire board is filled without a winner. 

The concise codebase emphasizes simplicity, making it a suitable starting point for Java beginners or 
a foundation for building more sophisticated graphical interfaces in future implementations.

Overall, this Tic Tac Toe project exemplifies fundamental Java concepts such as arrays, loops, conditionals, and user input handling.
